The updated VS Code Extension CLI tool is indeed `@vscode/vsce`, which replaces the older `vsce` package. It's maintained by Microsoft and handles packaging, publishing, and management of extensions more reliably, especially for newer VS Code versions. You can install it globally with:
```
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
```
Then, use it for packaging your project (e.g., `@vscode/vsce package`) instead of the old `vsce` command— the flags and behavior are otherwise identical.

Regarding suggestions to "package part of the libraries to create WASM dependencies" for your Gitmark eCash extension: This likely stems from the need to handle cryptographic or blockchain-related operations in a way that's portable and performant within VS Code's runtime environment (which is based on Electron/Node.js). Your project's wallet features (e.g., seed phrase generation, address handling, transaction signing, and blockchain anchoring via Chronik) probably rely on eCash-specific libraries that use or can benefit from WebAssembly (WASM) for core functionality like elliptic curve cryptography (e.g., secp256k1 for signing). WASM avoids issues with native Node modules (which can fail in packaged extensions due to runtime mismatches) and ensures compatibility across platforms, including potential web extension modes.

Based on common eCash libraries (like `ecash-lib`, which is designed for transaction building and explicitly uses WASM for accelerated crypto ops), here's how to interpret and act on those suggestions:

### Why WASM for Your Project?
- eCash operations often involve heavy crypto (e.g., ECDSA signing, hash functions) that pure JavaScript handles slowly or insecurely. Libraries like `ecash-lib` compile performance-critical parts (e.g., secp256k1) to WASM for speed and portability.
- In debug mode (F5 in VS Code), your extension runs with full access to local `node_modules`, so WASM or native deps load fine. In packaged mode (`.vsix`), dependencies are bundled/excluded based on your setup, and VS Code's Electron runtime may not resolve native modules correctly without rebuilding, leading to errors in wallet functions (e.g., "module not found" or runtime crashes during signing/balance queries).
- Switching to or ensuring WASM-based deps resolves this by treating WASM files as static assets that load dynamically, without native compilation hassles.
- VS Code has strong WASM support since mid-2024, including execution in workers for better isolation and performance. This is especially useful for extensions like yours that might evolve to web-compatible versions.

If your project already uses `ecash-lib` (or similar like `chronik-client` with crypto utils), it auto-loads WASM from version 2.0.0 onward—no explicit `initWasm()` needed. If not, consider adding it (`npm install --save ecash-lib`) for wallet/transaction logic, as it's browser/Node-compatible and MIT-licensed.

### Steps to Prepare and Package with WASM Dependencies
Follow these to integrate WASM-handling libs and ensure they're packaged correctly. This builds on the general preparation from before (e.g., compile TS, update `.vscodeignore`).

1. **Audit and Update Dependencies**:
   - Check your `package.json` for crypto/wallet deps (e.g., `ecashaddrjs` for addresses, `chronik-client` for blockchain queries, or any secp256k1 wrappers). Move them to `"dependencies"` if misplaced.
   - Add or replace with WASM-friendly eCash libs if needed:
     ```
     npm install --save ecash-lib
     ```
     This pulls in ~1.72 MB of files, including WASM modules. Update your wallet code to use it (e.g., import `Ecc` for signing transactions).
   - Avoid native-heavy libs (e.g., if using something like `node-secp256k1`, switch to WASM equivalents to prevent rebuild needs).

2. **Handle WASM in Code**:
   - In your wallet-related files (e.g., `src/wallet.ts`), import and use the lib:
     ```typescript
     import { Ecc, Script, Transaction, Utxo } from 'ecash-lib';  // Example for signing a tx

     // Example: Sign a transaction (WASM handles the crypto under the hood)
     async function signTransaction(inputs: Utxo[], outputs: Script.Output[]) {
       const ecc = new Ecc();  // WASM-accelerated
       const tx = new Transaction();
       // Add inputs/outputs, then sign
       tx.sign(ecc, ...);
       return tx;
     }
     ```
     No extra WASM init is required in recent versions.
   - If custom WASM loading is needed (e.g., for older lib versions), set a URL path relative to your extension's bundle (e.g., via `locateFile` in Emscripten-based libs).

3. **Build and Bundle with WASM Support**:
   - Use a bundler like webpack to include WASM files as assets (vsce doesn't bundle automatically; it just zips files). Install:
     ```
     npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli ts-loader copy-webpack-plugin
     ```
   - Create/update `webpack.config.js` in root:
     ```javascript
     const path = require('path');
     const CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');

     module.exports = {
       entry: './src/extension.ts',
       target: 'node',  // For desktop extensions
       output: {
         path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'out'),
         filename: 'extension.js',
         libraryTarget: 'commonjs2',
         assetModuleFilename: '[name][ext]'  // Preserve WASM file names
       },
       resolve: { extensions: ['.ts', '.js'] },
       module: {
         rules: [
           { test: /\.ts$/, exclude: /node_modules/, use: 'ts-loader' },
           { test: /\.wasm$/, type: 'asset/resource' }  // Handles WASM as files
         ]
       },
       externals: { vscode: 'commonjs vscode' },
       plugins: [
         new CopyPlugin({
           patterns: [
             // Copy WASM from node_modules if not auto-bundled by lib
             { from: 'node_modules/ecash-lib/dist/*.wasm', to: 'wasm/' }  // Adjust path as needed
           ]
         })
       ]
     };
     ```
     This copies WASM files (e.g., secp256k1.wasm) to `out/wasm/` and emits them as assets.
   - Update `package.json`:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "compile": "webpack --mode development",
       "build": "webpack --mode production",
       "vscode:prepublish": "npm run build"
     },
     "main": "./out/extension.js"
     ```
   - Run `npm run build` to compile and bundle.

4. **Update `.vscodeignore`**:
   - Ensure WASM files aren't excluded:
     ```
     **/*.ts
     **/*.map
     .git**
     node_modules/**  # But webpack bundles needed parts
     !out/**/*.wasm  # Include bundled WASM
     ```

5. **Package with `@vscode/vsce`**:
   - Run:
     ```
     @vscode/vsce package
     ```
     This triggers `vscode:prepublish` (your build), bundles everything (including WASM in `out/`), and creates the `.vsix`.
   - If WASM loading fails in tests (e.g., path resolution), use relative URLs in code: `new URL('./wasm/secp256k1.wasm', import.meta.url)`.

6. **Test and Debug WASM Issues**:
   - Install the `.vsix` and test wallet functions. Use VS Code's Extension Host console for errors (e.g., "Failed to load WASM module").
   - If native modules are still involved (not fully WASM), add `electron-rebuild` to devDeps and run `npx electron-rebuild` before building. 
   - For advanced WASM (e.g., in workers), follow VS Code's guides on WebAssembly execution. 

This should resolve compilation/runtime errors for wallet functions in packaged mode. If the exact error messages point to specific libs (e.g., "Cannot find module 'secp256k1'"), share them for more targeted fixes. Your extension's blockchain-anchoring feature is cool—WASM will make it more robust!
