## Marking a Commit Workflow

Yes, that is the correct process.

You must commit your code changes to your local Git repository before running the "Mark Commit" command.

Here‚Äôs the correct workflow:

1. Make your code changes.
2. Stage the changes (e.g., `git add .`).
3. Commit the changes (e.g., `git commit -m "Your message"`). This creates a new commit with a unique hash.
4. Run the **Gitmark: Mark Commit** command.
